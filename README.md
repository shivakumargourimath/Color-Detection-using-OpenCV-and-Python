# Color-Detection-using-OpenCV-and-Python
The Color Detection Project leverages the capabilities of OpenCV and Python to create a system for identifying and naming colors in images.

The project utilizes a dataset ('colors.csv') that maps RGB values to color names, providing a foundation for accurate color recognition.
